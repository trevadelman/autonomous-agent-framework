# Agentic Framework Model Selection Guide (with Chart Insights)

This guide covers five key OpenAI models—**GPT‑3.5 Turbo**, **GPT‑4o mini**, **o3‑mini**, **DALL‑E**, and **Whisper**—to address a range of tasks (text generation, multimodal processing, creative image output, and audio transcription). The included charts reinforce a few important tradeoffs between intelligence, price, and output speed.

> **Note:** For the most current details on features, performance, and pricing, see the [openai.com documentation](https://openai.com).

## Key Insights from Charts

1. **Reasoning vs. Price/Speed**  
   - **o3‑mini** generally scores higher on advanced reasoning tasks (e.g., MMLU‑Pro, GPa Diamond, Humanity’s Last Exam) than simpler models.  
   - This better performance comes with a higher relative cost and slightly slower output speed.  
   - If your task requires deeper logic or domain knowledge, o3‑mini is the stronger choice.

2. **Multimodal vs. Reasoning**  
   - **GPT‑4o mini** supports text, image, and audio inputs but tends to score slightly lower than o3‑mini on purely text-based or scientific reasoning benchmarks.  
   - However, for tasks needing images or audio, GPT‑4o mini’s multimodal support may outweigh the raw text reasoning gap.

3. **Cost‑Effectiveness**  
   - **GPT‑3.5 Turbo** remains the cheapest and often the fastest for everyday text generation.  
   - While it has lower scores on advanced benchmarks, it is ideal for routine tasks and high-volume usage.

4. **Visual Generation**  
   - **DALL‑E** is a separate image-generation model, priced per image.  
   - For creative or design tasks, DALL‑E is unmatched in generating custom visuals from text prompts.

5. **Audio Transcription**  
   - **Whisper** delivers reliable speech-to-text at a reasonable price.  
   - Perfect for transcribing interviews, voice commands, or other audio data.

## Model Summaries

### GPT‑3.5 Turbo
- **Role:** Cheapest text model for simple tasks and high‑volume usage.  
- **When to Choose:**  
  - Day-to-day chat, content drafting, or QA with minimal complexity.  
  - Tight budget or large-scale text operations.  
- **Tradeoff:**  
  - Lowest cost, but underperforms on advanced reasoning.

### GPT‑4o mini
- **Role:** Multimodal model (text, images, audio) at a moderate cost.  
- **When to Choose:**  
  - You need image or audio inputs but want to keep costs lower than the full GPT‑4o model.  
- **Tradeoff:**  
  - Versatile in format, but may not excel at purely text-based benchmarks.

### o3‑mini
- **Role:** Reasoning‑focused text model for complex logic.  
- **When to Choose:**  
  - Tasks that demand deep analysis, step-by-step reasoning, or higher accuracy.  
- **Tradeoff:**  
  - Higher cost and somewhat slower speed, but stronger performance on advanced benchmarks.

### DALL‑E
- **Role:** Generates images from text prompts.  
- **When to Choose:**  
  - Creative or design projects where you need custom visuals.  
- **Tradeoff:**  
  - Pay per image; no text-based outputs beyond the image descriptions.

### Whisper
- **Role:** Audio‑to‑text transcription and speech recognition.  
- **When to Choose:**  
  - Capturing and transcribing interviews, voice commands, or real-time audio.  
- **Tradeoff:**  
  - Very cost-effective for audio, but does not generate textual answers beyond transcriptions.

## Decision Framework

1. **Assess Task Complexity**  
   - If the job involves **complex reasoning** or domain expertise, consider **o3‑mini**.  
   - If it’s straightforward text generation, **GPT‑3.5 Turbo** is cost-effective.

2. **Check Modality Requirements**  
   - If the job needs **images or audio** as input, use **GPT‑4o mini**.  
   - If you need **visual output**, rely on **DALL‑E**.  
   - If you need **speech-to-text**, use **Whisper**.

3. **Balance Intelligence vs. Price & Speed**  
   - The charts confirm that **more intelligent** models (o3‑mini) **cost more** or may be slower.  
   - Cheaper models (GPT‑3.5 Turbo) handle routine tasks efficiently.

4. **Iterate & Refine**  
   - Start with the least expensive model that meets your needs.  
   - Only upgrade to higher-cost models if performance on your benchmarks is insufficient.
